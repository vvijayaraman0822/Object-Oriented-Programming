# SPACE ASTEROID
- This program has three classes named Ship, AsteroidList and Asteroid and uses an array to hold x and y coordinates.
  We build a Spaceship and control its actions, on.  A spaceship will search a “field” of asteroids and go to the 
  closest asteroid. The remaining asteroids are computed again, and the spaceship will go the next closest asteroid.  
  It will continue to do this for the number of asteroids that the user wants collect. The program takes in an input
  file named input.txt and the outfile is named output.txt.
