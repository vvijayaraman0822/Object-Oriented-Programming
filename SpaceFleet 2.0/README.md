# SpaceFleet 2.0

- This program has six classes named SpaceCraft, AsteroidList, SpaceObject, SpaceProbe and Spaceship and Asteroid. 
- The main concept used is this program in inheritance and overriding. uses an array to hold x and y coordinates.
- We build a Spaceship and control its actions, on.  A spaceship will search a “field” of asteroids and go to the 
  closest asteroid. The remaining asteroids are computed again, and the spaceship will go the next closest asteroid.  
- It will continue to do this for the number of asteroids that the user wants collect. The program takes in an input
  file named input.txt and the outfile is named output.txt
